a)
Solution vector x:
2.130435
2.695652
-0.173913
-0.652174

b)
Residual vector r:
0.000000e+00
-8.881784e-16
0.000000e+00
0.000000e+00

c)
Explanation:
Residual vector r is not exactly zero due to numerical rounding errors.
MATLAB uses floating-point arithmetic, which can introduce small errors.
These errors occur because computers store numbers in binary with limited precision.
